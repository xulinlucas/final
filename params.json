People always care about the dark horse since it is related to the prediction before match. In this project, we will focus on tennis tournaments and find some patterns about dark horse in different aspects.\r\n   \r\nData:\r\n1. Resource:\r\nFor female matches: [linked phrase](http://tennis-data.co.uk/2014w/2014.zip)\r\nFor male mathes: [linked phrase](http://tennis-data.co.uk/2014w/2014.zip)\r\n2. Description: The data included all the tennis mathes results in 2014 (both male and female). \r\nImportant Key to data:\r\nTournament = Name of tounament (including sponsor if relevant)\r\nSeries = Name of ATP tennis series (Grand Slam, Masters, International or International Gold)\r\nTier = Tier (tournament ranking) of WTA tennis series.\r\nCourt = Type of court (outdoors or indoors)\r\nSurface = Type of surface (clay, hard, carpet or grass)\r\nWinner = Match winner\r\nLoser = Match loser\r\nWRank = ATP Entry ranking of the match winner as of the start of the tournament\r\nLRank = ATP Entry ranking of the match loser as of the start of the tournament\r\nAvgW= Average odds of match winner (as shown by Oddsportal.com)\r\nAvgL= Average odds of match loser (as shown by Oddsportal.com)\r\n\r\nAnalysis:\r\n1. Abstract all the matches that 'dark horse' occurred.\r\n2. In term of players, calculate:\r\ndark win rate: percentage of becoming a 'dark horse'\r\ndark lose rate: percentage of being defeated by a 'dark horse'\r\npre adv rate: percentage of having advantages before match\r\nstability: percentage of being consisitent with the prior prediction\r\n3. In term of tournames, calculate:\r\ndark horse rate: percentage of having 'dark horse' in the tournament\r\n4. Compare the male and female data\r\n\r\nVisualization:\r\nPart 1: Use the scatter plot to analysis different players and then classify them with the result:\r\n```{r,echo=FALSE}\r\nsetwd('D:/R/final_project')\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\nlibrary(plyr)\r\nlibrary(reshape)\r\nwta_player = read.csv('wta_player.csv')\r\natp_player = read.csv('atp_player.csv')\r\nwta_player$gender = 'female'\r\natp_player$gender = 'male'\r\nPlayer = rbind(wta_player,atp_player)\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=dark_win_per,y=dark_los_per,label=Name,colour=gender))+geom_point(size=3)+geom_text(size=3)+\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.02, y = -0.04, xend = -0.02, yend = 0.63),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x =  0.2, y = -0.04, xend =  0.2, yend = 0.63),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x =  0.4, y = -0.04, xend =  0.4, yend = 0.63),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x =  0.6, y = -0.04, xend =  0.6, yend = 0.63),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.04, y = -0.02, xend = 0.63, yend = -0.02),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.04, y = .2, xend = 0.63, yend = 0.2),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.04, y = .4, xend = 0.63, yend = 0.4),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = -0.04, y = .6, xend = 0.63, yend = 0.6),col='blue') +\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .05, y = 0.63, label = \"unlikey to be dark house\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .3, y = 0.63, label = \"normal\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .5, y = 0.63, label = \"likely to be dark house\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -.05, y = 0.1, label = \"unlikely to be 'darked'\",size = 4)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -.05, y = 0.3, label = \"normal\",size = 4)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = -.05, y = 0.5, label = \"likely to be 'darked'\",size = 4)\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=adv_per,y=stability,label=Name,colour=gender))+geom_point(size=3)+geom_text(size=3)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .4, y = 0.91, label = \"normal player\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .7, y = 0.91, label = \"good player\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .85, y = 0.91, label = \"advanced player\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .95, y = 0.91, label = \"top player\",size = 5)+\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.2, y = .5, xend = 0.2, yend = 0.95),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.6, y = .5, xend = 0.6, yend = 0.95),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.8, y = .5, xend = 0.8, yend = 0.95),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.9, y = .5, xend = 0.9, yend = 0.95),col='blue') + \r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.1, y = .6, xend = 1, yend = 0.6),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.1, y = .7, xend = 1, yend = 0.7),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.1, y = .8, xend = 1, yend = 0.8),col='blue') +\r\n  geom_segment(aes(x = 0.1, y = .9, xend = 1, yend = 0.9),col='blue') +\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .15, y = 0.55, label = \"very unstable\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .15, y = 0.65, label = \"unstable\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .15, y = 0.75, label = \"stable\",size = 5)+\r\n  annotate(\"text\", x = .15, y = 0.85, label = \"vert stable\",size = 5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPart 2: Use the boxplot to compare dark horse rate of tournaments in terms of level, surface, type\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\nwta_tour = read.csv('wta_tournament.csv')\r\natp_tour = read.csv('atp_tournament.csv')\r\nwta_tour$gender = 'female'\r\natp_tour$gender = 'male'\r\nlevels(atp_tour$Tier)= c('International','Premier','Grand Slam','PremierM','SEC')\r\ntour=rbind(wta_tour,atp_tour)\r\nggplot(tour,aes(x=Tier,y=dark_per,label=Tournament,colour=gender))+geom_point(size=5)+ facet_grid(. ~ type)\r\nggplot(tour,aes(x=Tier,y=dark_per,colour=gender))+geom_boxplot()\r\nggplot(tour,aes(x=Tier,y=dark_per,colour=gender))+geom_boxplot()+facet_grid(. ~ type)\r\n```\r\n\r\nPart 3: Compare the male and female player\r\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=gender,y=stability))+geom_boxplot()\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=gender,y=adv_per))+geom_boxplot()\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=gender,y=dark_win_per))+geom_boxplot()\r\nggplot(Player,aes(x=gender,y=dark_los_per))+geom_boxplot()\r\n```\r\n[aaa](file:///C:/Users/dell/Desktop/xulin.html)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
